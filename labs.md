# Web 3 & Social Impact

[Inaugural Seminar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHCtkOeiCXQ)

# Lab Travail

In line with RadicalxChange vision and modus operandi, we want to offer spaces and technical know-how at the local level and for specific use cases where to develop without ideological barriers or political constraints, out-of-the-box, simple to implement tools and systems. 

From the ground-up, starting with education and local experimentation, our goal is to empower citizens and see flourish alternative forms of asset ownership, wealth distribution, public financing and deliberative governance. 

A multi-stakeholder approach involving civil organizations, local communities and governments, public and private institutions will be quintessential to the success of our initiatives, creating a rewarding feedback loop and lasting imprint.
