# Internet For Trust / UNESCO

How to define a new framework for regulating digital social platforms in the age of increasing misinformation spreading while safeguarding freedom of expression, preserving information as a public good, and offering a voice to all communities. RadicalxChange was actively engaged in this multi stakeholder global dialogue that started at the Internet4Trust conference held in Paris in February 2023.


During this months-long process, RadicalxChange shared its innovative ideas, designs and tools to empower citizens around data dignity, community governance or information provenance and "level the playing field.

# OECD

RadicalxChange France representing the RxC Foundation has recently joined a forum of global civic tech organizations to work with OECD and inform on how to improve citizen participation, government/citizens interactions and collaborative policymaking.

# Plurality

Plurality, a movement dedicated to preserving digital democracy through the use of plural technologies. This work builds on ideas developed by Audrey Tang (Digital Minister of Taiwan), Glen Weyl (Economist and Research Lead at Microsoft), and other leaders synthesized in the book: [Plurality: The Future of Collaborative Technology and Democracy](https://www.plurality.net/).

## Plurality Tour

Audrey and Glen are planning to be in Europea at the end of May 2024 as part of the worldwide Plurality campaign and will stop in Madrid, Paris, Berlin, Amsterdam, Split and Warsaw to speak with EU academic and political leaders and connect with global leaders and entrepreneurs, together charting a path to re-engineer socioeconomic structures to serve the public good.

Plurality has already encountered a global echo and audience with hundreds collaborating in an open source format and leading publications and institutions showcasing our work.
